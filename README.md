 david_hume_interactive_visualisation_project
It was my first aproximation to use  the game engine Unity3D as a tool for interactive visualisation. Although, it is a very simple game, I dedicated it around 80 Hours.
  In this project I learned how to model a terrain using "Autodesk 3D max" , obtain a photogrammetry model from the sculpture of Hume and connected with a data base from internet, in this case "wikipedia".
